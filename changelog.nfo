Story of the Lost Legacy:
 
ACT I: The crash.

After hundreds of years spent in cryogenic hibernation, the imperial colonization fleet of humatran had finally arrived at destination: The first system of the edge of the closest galaxy. The life systems were reactivated in each starship and vessel and all the crews began with being awoken when the external warning systems are activated. The star of the system that they had chosen as destination was in its final phase of life, and well before what they had provided before their departure. 
At once the emergency plan of launched repatriation. But too late, the bad luck was still on them, the star began its explosion... 

A ray of a sharp red put to shine in all space around them. Panic seized each one and each spaceship started to operate in order to be the first to set out again. The small vessels, lighter and more handy, were already in the axis of return and had begun to accelerate, while largest like, the flagships hardly came to start his turn. When the first wave of the explosion reached the fleet, the lightest vessels were at once to sweep like simple sheets with the wind, while the majority of largest started with disintagrate slowly. Luckiest of these had begun the phase of acceleration by choosing other axes of folds, when the second and last blast reached the fleet... 

The fleet was almost destroyed by this second deadly blast, the vessels which survived there were only one handle and the state of each one of them be pitiful. Only one could still make fully function its engines and immediately undertook operations of accostings to rescue the crew of the other mostly destroyed ships. But the return in their galaxy was impossible, all auto-navigation systems were out of oder like all the communication systems. Their only hope, quite mean, was to find a planet to be able to settle there as they would have to do it but under other conditions. 

They spent the whole months in space in the search of a planet to enable them to live, when finally they approached the first whose characteristics was not completely hostile. In any event they did not have the choice because the food were insufficient to continue and the life on board man-of-war was uncomfortable and became insuportable. When the vessel entering the atmosphere began its landing operation, the undergone damages were much more serious than envisaged. The control sytems in atmosphere burnt the ones after the others and the crash of the vessel was sure... The crew did run in all rescue pods. The vessel released plenty thus small pods which moved towards the surface of planet with softness while it continued its infernal descent. 

ACT II: Birth of a giant. 

The first members of crew whose landed pods had already begun their new life on this planet of the hundreds of survivors gathered for origaniser the localization and the search for their vessel. When they arrived on the place of the crash, there remained only burning sheets on the ground. It remain to them nothing!!! No more space transports, neither communication systems, nor tools. They were all to rebuild, all to rediscover, all relearn... But life taken again well quickly... 

A few hundred years later, the following generations which had colonized the planet, rebuilt all the technology of which old theirs had transmitted the knowledge and the plans to through the few holodisk ones. They relearned to travel trough space and leave to conquer the galaxy. They meet other civilizations, of which some had common ancestors, "travellers of stars" as called them by still primitive tribes which were descandant of other vessels which had not been able to join their galaxy of origin... 

The hostile meetings also multiplied and the wars were not rare. The pacts of peace, the treaties of alliance or civilizations extraterrestrial which were integrated into their, contributed to reinforce their force, their capacity, their knowledge and their technology. Their power and them influance on the galaxy, made only grow. When the moment had come they think to find their lost Legacy, their civilization of origin of which they had been cut for a long time... 

Not having any report/ratio coming from the probes which they had sent they envoy a large fleet of reconquer. This new fleet of return to their galaxy of origin began to start through space and travelled during years... But what they found while arriving in this galaxy was very far from being as what reported the old men holidisks... The planets were devastated by wars whose forces could be only of galactic size. The surface of each planet which they visited were completely destroyed. no more resources, nor trace of life, only of the traces of violent wars and dead civilizations. no more sign of their civilization mother. The first meeting with the forces armed with the two camps in war was far from being peaceful because each one saw in them a potential danger, a trick of the enemy, and thus was to thus treat them as enemies. 

These quarrelsome forces bore the name of the CORE and the ARM...

  * Fixed mex-upgrader to again work with area command. It reverses one lua-error fix, but it's a rare one and it's better than area command works
  * Now there are no more bugs in xta: please report more bugs to http://code.google.com/p/xta-springrts/issues/list
  * Reduce non-gunship aircraft brakerate to 10% like it was before engine removed the scale factor. However, it doesn't seem to fix stopping bombers


XTA 9.736 (Svn 642)

15/03/2014

  * Fixed (hopefully) all bugs relating to end statistics and the internal procedure relating to it. Added two small buttons in 
  top right corner that let's you toggle between both graphs
  * Airplanes now have less LOS and less AirLOS when they are landed. Now you can't land a peeper in a remote corner and gain LOS of it until enemy discovers it.
  * Fixed bug where landed fighters keep shooting at enemy stuff
  * Increased turnrate of torpedoes from seaplanes so that they won't miss ships if dropped too close to them (15000 -> 25000)
  * Added visual effects that help you see when a seaplane has submerged under water and risen above it again
  * Fixed some ships shooting at aircraft (missile frigates, warlord, etc)
  * Fixed bug where only arm construction seaplane could submerge and not core: now they both can
  * Enable depthmod for some kbots and tanks, means that units move slower the deeper the water is: 
	-  Fido, maverick, can: max.slowdown in water = 33% 
	-  gimp, spiders: 50% 
	-  commanders: 45%
	-  beaver, crab, triton, crock, garpike, muskrat: 50%
	-  crawling bombs: 33%

Widgets: 
  * mex upgrader error fixed, added options to tweak-gui widget: fullscreen option (requires spring 97), option to turn off move-failed notifications when builder can't reach target), made select and center widget faster to zoom.

  * Fixed collisionvolumes of all wrecks of standard units, thanks to raaar
  * Decreased LOS of some turrets, such as LLT, MT and Radars. Instead they have increased air-LOS. LOS: Flakkers: 600, HLT: 600,
  LLT: 420, floating LLT: 480, MT: 450, radar jammer tower: 450, radar tower: 500, adv. radar tower: 550, nuke/mininuke: 500
  * Decreased LOS of commanders: 768-> 720.

  * Increased sonars: adv.sonar stations: arm: 1550->2050, core: 1500->2010 (t1 sonar stations unchanged at 1210/1200)
  * Decreased cloaktimeout for automatic commanders: arm: 4.2 s -> 2.8, core: 4.2 s -> 3.0. The commander is visible somewhat longer than this time due to the silhouette effect. Also decreased for level 2 manual commanders: 4.2-> 3.4/3.6; L3 and L4 have 
  same values as automatic commanders.
  * Increased area of effect of rocko/storm: 48 -> 65. This will deal a little damage to walled mexxes/llt:s
  * Increased annihilator/doomsday machine explodeas-radius: 180->360 and damage 800->1400.
  * All builders can now restore again
  * Increased missile velocities a little
  * Increased phalanx/copperhead *air*-los

Lua: 
  * Fixed adv. playerslist widget, buildspeed gadget. Improved unit under attack sounds widget to be less annoying. Added new version of ally resource bars widget. New endgame statistics gadget.

  * Added some new widgets: specific unit reclaimer, smart area reclaim, mouse cursors, underwater blue, deferred lighting
Unit: reinstate sniper's special damages versus core the Can and core Sumo, and as counterweight reduce it's hp from 1190 to 900. Scout	planes are slower so that they can be intercepted more easily.

Game: 
  * make dynamic lights a mod option. New: DT crush effect, Mexx cloud explosion, Loaded non-air transporters can leave wrecks of destroyed units when they die.

XTA 9.73 (Svn 545)
|dnw, jls, klt, nor and kno
08/11/2013

* New things:
  Updated Xtaids, added new unitpack that functions, called spiders vs. tortoise. Both work need more balance tests. Noruas
  Added area guard gadget and widget combo. Works like area attack but for guard command. Enable/disable by toggling the Area 
	Guard widget in F11 menu. Widget listens to keyboard shortcut "g". The widget has three modes:
	
	1) Basic mode: drag over units to guard, all selected units will guard all units.
	2) Distributive mode (hold alt and drag): distribute the guard task into squadrons based on how many units you have selected
	  to guard.
	3) Persistent mode (hold alt+ctrl and drag): makes the squadrons permanent. When one unit in the squadron gets damaged, the 
	  unit guarding the squadron will shift the guard task to prioritise the unit wth least health. Selecting a unit that is 
	  guarding a squadron and pressing "stop" will also clear the guard task.
	  
  New spectator mode in commander change widget
  Added buttons for selecting game speed when watching replays
  Zombie mode
  New mouse cursors: select, airstrike, bad load, bad unload, upgrade metal extractor
  New bloomshader widget
  Updated pause screen. It has music that can be disabled/enabled with commands /musicoff and /musicon or /disablemusic and /enablemusic
  New loading screen. Loading music can be enabled/disabled by setting "snd_intromusic" to 1/0 in springsettings.cfg
  New commander songs
  Team-died messages make their comeback: suggest new ones in forum
  Smarter logic for unit under attack warning sounds
  
* Changes:
  Increased cost of Guardian and Punisher shots to double, from 250 to 500 per shot, roughly twice as much and a bit more than 
	a pop up cannon at 230 Energy.
  Reduced cost of stealthing for Cloakable fusion reactors and spy kbots by 50E
  Aircraft plants include runways for hit detection and selection
  Increase metal costs of Freedom Fighter, Avenger, Thunder and Shadow by about 10 %, increase energy cost and build time too.
    Decrease HP of same units by 10 % and more for scout planes. Decrease fire angle of T1 fighters 100 => 70 and T2 fighters 110 => 90
  In game with commander ends: winner will not be last commander alive if he dguns enemy commander

* Bugfixes: 
  Added missing minelayer-limit icons, fixed bug for xtaids hovercraft minelayers. jls
  Mine layer gadget fixed for XTAids units and other bugs Noruas
  Fixed a bug with moho metal maker's missing explosions: they were set to "", now they use same explosions as in BA
  Fixed minelayer mine-limit exploit. Now it won't finish the mine if it's not in stock.
  Fixed double projectile for CORE Garpike and ARM Crab, making them quite OP for their price
  Fixed Dynamic Collision Volume gadget not scaling 3DO model radius and height if used for a unit with a dynamic CV
  Fixed many oversized collision volumes, happened due to changes in 94.1 engine
  Fix same faction image always being drawn onto ground for all players
  Kamikaze units can also attack with the attack command in addition to self-destruct one.
  Fix Z-selector widget to work again.
  Add arrival sound for arm small hovercraft
  Fix sub pens not having move command
  
* Performance improvements:
  Add flood protection to local sounds gadget
  Optimizations in following widgets:
  
	- Major: Adv. Players List, Commander Selection, Commander Nametags
	- Minor: Ghost Radar, Mission UI, BuildETA, UnitGroups
	- Symbolical: BuildBar, Waypoint Dragger, Selection Buttons

  Improve performance of Dynamic Lighting when used together with Local Sounds, otherwise no performance change
  Updated CustomFormations to show end points for unit destinations, some other small fixes
  Halved the number of flame projectiles per second for Pyros and Levelers, damage and visuals adjusted to look and feel as before

* SVN:
  Rename all files that had upper-case letters to lower-case (fixes possible linux vs windows issues)


XTA v9.729
|dnw, jls,nor and kno
25/05/2013

* Added animals that wander around the map:

	- critters are invisible on minimap+radar and have a blank icon, as not to be confused with player units
   enjoy the amazing duck and friends! I tried to not make them interfere with gameplay as much as possible  
	- for now, mostly only on ffa maps where it often has less serious games anyway
	- attacking them is not possible, to avoid units accidently following them around the map
	- critters are placed in ways where they will not get in the way
	- they can be reclaimed instantly (should they block construction)
	- they are killed easily (near explosions etc), but still they CAN decloak cloaked units ... not sure how to fix that and how  much it matters. If in doubt, reclaim them.
	- they spawn on the maps defined in gaia_critters_config.lua
	- modoptions "critters" = false to turn them off.

* Some bugfixes: missing sound on volume control and bug in commander change widget.

! The downloads of 9.728 got corrupted, which caused desyncs. So this release is mostly an attempt to fix this.


XTA v9.728
|dnw, jls and nor
24/05/2013

  * Fix landboat transition from land to water
  * Improve commander selection widget (remembers selection from last game, better countdown text)
  * Bugfixes for minelayer and buildspeed gadgets (probable cause for error: builder died)
  * New sounds for D-Gun, Arm Penetrator and Core Doomsday machine. Sounds by Noruas. Should be less disturbing.
  * Update cursor out of range gadget. It now gets range from engine. Cursor will still show bad attack cursor if 
  attack is blocked, but attack order is only dropped if it is outside of range (only for turrets).
  * New splash sound for lava maps.
  * Builders can now again fight.
  * Fix hitsoundwet sound for Arm Bulldog
  * Optimise MinimapX gadget to use less fps
  * Force some gadgets that wouldn't unload to really do so (gadgets that have synced and unsynced parts).


XTA v9.727
|dnw and jls 
20/05/2013

  * Widget to set commander as member of group number 1 on gamestart (default disabled).
  * Add avoidGround=0; and avoidNeutral=0; to disintegrator weapons.
  * Update mission stuff
  * Add debug mode (allows gadget profiler to run, use it to troubleshoot which gadget is the problem)
  * Remove stop and wait commands from units that cannot do that,
  remove fight from units that cannot attack (like mine layers, construction
  units, air scouts, spies), remove attack from anti-nukes (they still do their
  thing), remove move, attack and patrol from air repair pad. Add a self-destruct
  button to all units (can be hidden with hidecommands.lua widget, that widget
  added to xta but isn't enabled by default).
  * Nerf ambusher and toaster range from 1330 to 1250 as it was in kloot's patches. Increase flak-weapon's
  projectile speed and areaofeffect (they differ, but for example arm flakker has
  speed 1950 -> 2450 and aoe 150 -> 176), and decrease their damage vs ground
  units by about 30%. Decreased flakker projectile's amount of particles from 20
  to 10 and their separation from 0.35 to 0.15.
  * Changed dragon's teeth's collision volume scales: arm: 28 34 28 -> 26 34 26,
  core: 26 36 26 -> 26 36 26, so that they let more shots pass.
  * Fix for anti-nuke interception fail
  * Set cannon velocity default to 0.25 instead of 0.5
  * Add reclaim method as mod option: continuous = instant reclaim, discreet = lump sum reclaim after completion
  * Fix hammer and jeffy
  * Add snd_volume_osd widget. Decrease/Increase sound with and +. Engine changed the shortcut for speed change to alt +/-
  * Prevent crashing aircraft from continuing to fire on enemies.	


XTA v9.726 (94.0 and next version)
|dnw, klt, jls, NTG and Scifi
05/04/2013

New features or technical changes:
  * Minelayers have a limited stock of mines (arm: 5, core: 6, naval: 8). Restocking costs same as building new minelayer (this is due to the fact that it's not as easy to build sensitive equipment such as mines in the field as inside factory conditions).
  * Changed the collision volume of dragon's teeth so that scouts can fire through. Will still require micro. Increased dt hit points back to previous value, because otherwise they get destroyed too quickly due to changes in engine i n v. 93 ->
  * Decreased duck odds from 1:100 to 1:1000
  * Changed some effects in water explosions, they are now different depending on water depth and explosion impact altitude
  * removed beeps from people placing their commander at start window (everybody hates it)
  * Units do not target crashing aircraft (no change from latest patch)
  * New sounds when units cloak or self-d (all combined in widget: xta unit sounds). 
  * Removed global sounds when commander cloaks or is repaired.

  * Enforcer: same thing (new values: metalcost: 887, energycost: 4505, buildtime: 13368, return to ota-values)
  * Guardian: metalcost: 2169 -> 3253.5, energycost: 45441 -> 22720
  * Punisher: metalcost: 2081 -> 3121.5, energycost: 45099 -> 22549
  * Hammer: Turnrate: 700 -> 475, Speed: 1.32 (1.20 in p1.7, 1.5 in 9.725)
  * Thud: Turnrate: 750 -> 495, Speed: 1.24 (1.15 in p1.7, 1.45 in 9.725). Slope tolerance 14 -> 18. This is an old ability the thud used to have, arm has the spider instead.
  * Jeffy: HP: 410 -> 273.33 (no change from latest patch)
  * Weasel: HP: 440 -> 293.33, Speed: 3.724 -> 3.74

  * Neutron: ennergycost: 258882 -> 129441, buildtime: 196784 -> 124423
  * Zeus: HP: 3100 -> 4200 (no change from latest patch)
  * Doomsday machine: HP: 9925 -> 7444 (no change from latest patch)

  * Fixed that Core Eraser and Arm Spector (Kbot jammers), once turned off no longer spin even when turned on.
  * Fixed that Seer's radar spins no matter if you turn it off or on.
  * Fixed that core T2 sub cannot make sub pens
  * T2 construction sub now has water radar next to standard radar in build menu
  * Removed "Reclaim", "Restore" and "Repair" from Colossus and Hive
  * Increase T1 kbot and veh build radiuses so that they can build the sub pen (now same as T2)
  * Set Airlabs to by default be turned on when built, so that their radar works
  * Fix the fact that the following naval series units weren't buildable due to bad value of maxwaterdepth: Dragon's Teeth NS, LLT NS, Floating metal maker, Flakker NS, Seaplane Platform, Cobra NS, All NS mines.

  * Fix for lose target on cloak
  * Fix for issues arising from targetting with D-Gun ground and friendly units (avoidfriendly and avoidground set to false for D-Gun weapons)
  * Fix for issue in local sounds mode (should work now)


XTA v9.726 beta (89.0 and next version)
|dnw and jls

  * Decoy commanders now have same cloak radius as their respective normal commanders. Their weapons ranges now show as that of normal commanders to enemies, but show still are actual ones to allies.Decoys can be upgrades to level 2 decoys, which can disguise as opposite faction commanders. Level 2 decoys appear to enemies as level 2 commanders (D-Gun still reveals though).
  * Added original commander ends option
  * Renamed modoptions: renamed "teamdeathmode" to "mode" and "comm" to "commander" to make it easier to use autohost  commands. mode options are: "killall" (kill all units and remove dead players), "comends" (team commander ends), "commander" (original commander ends), "team" (kill all units and retain dead players) and "none" (game never ends). Spads command "!bset mode killall" replaces old "!bset teamdeathmode allyzerounits" which was a bit complicated.
  * Fixed "Team death on zero commanders"
  * Added a gadget to draw an X on minimap for nukes and antinukes (within radar coverage)
  * Fixed arm_wombat issue where it was targetting aircraft
  * On rare occasions explosions near the coast can hit ducks
  * Fixed the logic in the sea splashes and underwater explosions, new sound for small splashes.
  * Added mod option to make sounds local (not audible for events outside line of sight). Loop-style sounds are not yet perfect (but working) with this option.
  * Changed visiblity outside LOS for some unit weapons (such as core pyro, core fusion and D-Gun)
  * Updated missions gadget with new trigger conditions and actions, implemented all missing features, some performance optimizations
  * Modified some gadgets and widgets for better interaction with mission scripting gadget
  * Updated Dynamic Collision Volume gadget to support radius and height scaling of buildings and aim point adjustment of popup style units
  * Fixed offset defense tower collision volumes caused by engine change (removal of modelCenterOffset tag), fixed failed aiming against pop-up cannons
  * Fixed freezing of pop-up defenses when pressing Open/Close button while changing state
  * Added Particle Light widget for faked light effects on cannon shells and laser cannons
  * Some small unit script fixes and optimizations

  * adjusted torpedo and adv. torpedo launchers min water depth and water line so that they don't sink into sea floor and can't shoot
  * adjusted rocket and missile flightTime to avoid excessive overshooting of max range when firing at aircraft

XTA 9.725p1.7 (Kloot's patches)
|klt and jls
27/01/2013

* Fix bug in crashing aircraft. Small fix to selfdcount widget. Crashing aircraft crash after having lost all hp. Chance still 33%. Lose radar and LOS when crashing.

XTA 9.725p1.6 (Kloot's patches)
|klt and jls
26/01/2013

* Fixed wrong player faction update in adv. playerslist
* Added widget with sound when cloaking, decloaking
* Added widget with sound when ordering self-d
* Added cursor out of range when ordering attack. Drop attack order when static defense orders an attack on ground, which is of range.
* Split sounds into following categories: explosions, gui and unitreply. Each has different parameters. This should also fix local sounds modoption, although that's hard to test without many players in a battle.
* Changed limit for shallow water from 50 to 25. Updated sound and splash gadgets. Changed CEG for splash and deep undersurface hit. Edit: there are two limits: 25 depth is when water is shallow. If explosion occurs above 5 then the explosion is termed shallow.
* Crashing aircraft can occur when hp is below 50%, and odds reduced from 100% to 33% Those are just some fast numbers and they can be tweaked. I don't think 100% should crash though.
* Remove Recvluarulesmsg callin after game start
* Improved performance of minimapX gadget. Fixed no self pwn one.
* Missions were added, but they are not part of this patch.

XTA v9.72 (89.0 and next version)
|dnw, jls and klt
15/07/2012 

  * Added support for changing Commanders in-game. New modoption: let users choose in game. Renamed Commander options to Automatic and Manual Commanders.
  * Rewrote commander selection widget from scratch. Now it interacts with initial queue and advanced playerslist, and also has some more functionality than the normal interface during pre-game phase (such as a gong-gong sound when game starts). Commanders are set to hold position on startup rather than maneuver.
  * Added "Team death on zero commanders", game mode that got removed with Spring 84 engine change
  * Adjusted the default on/off for many widgets
  * Updated several gadgets and widgets to newer versions
  * Fixed the following widgets to work with current version of spring (version 85 and above): dontshoot (puts commander on hold fire during cloak), forcecloak(gives a wait order to the commander if user wants to cloak while the commander is in the process of building something)
  * Added following widgets: Red_resourcebars and red_tooltip (they need red_ui_framework and red_ui_drawing to work), gui_point_tracker (displays labels added by other players on minimap), Ghosted Buildings and Ghosted radar
  * Improved Default XTA GUI Layout widget with the ability to select different icon grid sizes: 3x8, 4x9 and 5x11 icons in Ctrl+F11 mode
  * Added an explosion effect to all gunships (they currently lacked one). Added a splash effect to explosions on water.
  * Fixed "King of The Hill" mode, no cloaked or stunned units, or units not on ground can maintain control. Added reminder and countdown sound when 30 secs left in KoTH mode.
  * Fixed many unwanted reverts that happened when releasing 9.71 (Raven, and Hammer/Thud are affected mostly)
  * Added RadarEmitHeight and LOSEmitHeight values to all towers, commanders and big ships, makes them see better on bumpy terrain or when climbing hills
  * Added option to adjust custom gravity of cannon weapons (effectivly it changes their projectile speed, smaller number -> slower cannon, default 0.5)
  * Added Plain Commander, without any upgrades
  * Added mod option do enable or disable aircraft vs aircraft collision, default no collision
  * All defense towers' aimspot now back in center, Spring 89.0 no longer supports modelCenterOffset tag, and it's an annoyance to adjust those via LUA, result, towers are less protected by dragon teeth walls
  * Expanded unit description for rocket toggle units so players can see which units can toggle rockets (and what type of rockets) before building them
  * Togglable rocket units now show attack range properly
  * Radar jammers, mine layers and mobile anti-nukes set to hold position by default
  * Fixed many yardmaps that caused warnings in the develop build, improves compatibility with upcoming Spring release
  * Fixed CORE Construction sub description having excess delimiters
  * Fixed Auto-upg. commanders wandering off into battle when set on maneuver, and always having max velocity regardless of XP (requires Spring 89)
  * Fixed starting resources always set to 1000/1000
  * Added dynamic lighting gadget, used for some (mostly large) explosions
  * Some updates in LUPS modules
  * Fixed lag when Flebowl boss is killed (not that it matters as the fleabowl gadget is still broken)
  * Added gadget for QTPFS units-stuck-in-factory bug workaround
  * Several gadgets updated for better MT compatibility
  * Combined Passive Builders and Build Speed gadgets into one, now uses just one command button instead of two
  * Added a rudimentary mission scripting gadget and 2 demo missions, look for details in XTA.sd7/Missions/Readme.txt

Requires 89.0 to work:
  * Updated Dynamic Collision Volume gadget for better map feature and unit CV and radius scaling
  * Renamed all soundHit tags in weaponDefs to soundHitDry, to be up to date with 89.0
  * Added weapon water hit sounds
  * Renamed cylinderTargetting to cylinderTargeting for engine compatibility
  * Added Sounds.lua for small randomization of general sound effects

  * Slightly increased metal extractor and moho mine slope tolerance
  * Increased ARM Infiltrator cost to match CORE Parasite, cloak, moving cloak & stealth costs now 150/300/600 for Infiltrator, 125/275/550 for Parasite, Infiltrator LoS set to 375, Parasite 320
  * Cannon weapons have a nice arc trajectory (relative to target range, at max range it's always 45∞ elevation)

These are still under probation, might not hang around for long:
 Disabled Aircraft and hovercraft on maps with no atmosphere, disabled Aircraft on maps with extreme wind (min>30 or max>35)
 ARM Ravens fire twice as many rockets per salvo that do half the damage each, AoE +50%, edgeEffectiveness=0, accuracy slightly increased, this gives Ravens a better area coverage with more evently distributed damage and less random strayed rockets

  * Fixed some of the Invisible Particles that were still rendered.
  * Doubled Accuracy of Crusader and Enforcer

  * Increased agility of ARM Atlas and CORE Valkyrie
  * Increased turret/torso turn speed for all T1 land units and all T2 Kbots that have weapons
  * Increased Stumpy/Raider damage to non-commanders by 25%  so far Flash/Gator are still better than Stumpy/Raider if combat groups are of equal total M cost
  * Increased weapon speed of almost all lasers (except for very short range ones), they now hit their target more often and sooner
  * Jeffy/Weasel HP, M & E cost reduced to 2/3, build time reduced to 5/6, sight range increased by 54%  as proposed by several community members
  * Adjusted Jeffy/Weasel wreckage M value (39M/40M)

  * Fixed COB error spam when using ARM Decoy Commander's fake D-Gun (bug brought to life in 9.641b)
  * Fixed radars turning off right after being constructed (partly or not at all, as it's related to your E production/consumption rate)
  * Mines now have very low profile, making most projectiles fly over them instead of crashing into
  * Aircraft plants added option to set default commands to aircraft, Land/Fly and Land at XX%
  * Unit experience is slightly more pronounced than in previous versions
  * Hovercraft transporters don't draw their crane faster than Lucky Luke, but at a reasonable tempo

  * Evil Krogoth Lag Bug fixed, it also lagged the CPU elsewhere before being finished built.
  * Arm and Core Torpedo Launchers in tech 1 are now Long Range Depth Chargers, they also have names now, Arm is Fisherman, while Core is Shrimper. 
  * Boat DepthChargers have 6 times the turnrate for accuracy improvements.
  * Increased range of Raven from 1200 to 1400, making it the only arty to outrange the popup cannons, but, it's very inaccurate at that range.
  * Added 50 Percent HP to Vehicle Mine Layers
  * Doubled Hp of Amphibious vehicle builders.
  * Spider laser has 20 particles vs 200 particles per beam, because I hear that Pentium 3s cry at night.
  * Hitsphers of mobile units are more accurate to the shape of the unit.
  * Jethros no longer hit each other when lined up firing from its broadside in close packs.
  * Spider has the ability to EMP overload itself, causing itself 33.4 percent damage and temporary paralyzing itself for 10-50 seconds. The small area surrounding the Spider takes mediocre damage and heavy paralyze damage of 5000, two Spiders can disarm a Bulldog or a Reaper. Takes one second to overload, and during that second, it will not fire.
  * Hovercraft transports now cost an additional 300 metal and 2000 E, with 1000 hp added to its health, much more inefficient and cost something awful to lose in midgame, or use as a stealer.
  * Reduced damage rate of peewee from 60 to 50 per second.
  * Increased hitpoints of A.K. and Instigator, the Peewee and Flash counter. Reduced metal of A.K. by 1 metal point. A.K. and Instigator will lose in close combat vs its counter part, and has less speed, but it has higher range which makes it able to have an initiative blow or the ability to kite for short time.
  * Tech 2 aircraft plants now have take 18 energy a second and has tech 2 radar range, just as tech 1 air labs do with tech 1 radars.
  * Farks and Necros now self-repair at 2 hitpoints per second, still remain fragile.
  * Tech 1 bombers behave better, bomb more likely. Downside, they fly through each other.
  * Reduced scout missile from 730 to 630 range, but has better flight time to follow air units outside its range. Added new sound and trail effect for its small missile, as well as some arc fire.

  * Amphib Level 1 Tanks now have their unique weapons.
  * Mine Layers now have a 5 second timer, called self-charge, which broadcast sounds and bright colors to all players as warning, side effect type thing before exploding, after 3 seconds, in the fourth second before discharge, self D will release a minesweeping effect if cancelled. After the 5th second, it explodes like a light mine.
  * Tics and Spidey mine sweeper spider kbots can now burrow through upgrade atm and cloak like a normal mine, can chain explode, take full damage from other mines, but has increased hitpoints.

Cloakable about 25 solars, produce 40 solars in output. Large Fusion reactor cost about 75 solars, and outputs 175 solars in output. Large fusions explode slightly round about 3000 damage to nearby buildings however within a small radius.
  * New fx for peewees.
  * Hovercrafts now behave like hovercrafts in animation style, rocking tilting, and floating, banking turns and great stuff.
  * Fluffly Puff Nano explosion added to construction units.
  * Completly Changed the scout hovercraft, due to it being more combat effective then the hovertank, and having stealth, speed advantages on top of that, although most players did not see this issue, it was in fact a unresolved issue. Gave it a unique weapon.
  * Hovertanks cost reduced by 50 metal, keep in mind they are very inefficent if used like tanks as the description asks for.
  * NanoTowers take twice as long to build
  * Zippers and Freakers now can stealth for an energy drain of 50E. *will probably remove, but its a tech 1.5 robot*
  * Cappies move faster now and are built faster.
  * Commanders can now sing from the original TA.
  * Doubled Turnrate of hovercrafts except the transport for scary reasons.
  * Boats now move more effectively, classified into 3 movements. Battleships and Carriers amongst the most restricted in shallow water, followed by subs, then meduim sized boats.
  * Krogoth now walks over 4 times as much metal as goliath and such, climbs abit better, and
  * can walk into deep water as long as its head can peep out.
  * Made pathfinding from 21 to 20, for faster loading.

  * Added Handy Retreat Lua to retreat to nano towers if it is not disabled.
  * Decreased Large Battleships' Hp by 6000 each. They pwn land very easily and is currently very hard to take out by air.
  * Metalcost pershot from raven is 18 metal!
  * Increased Metal cost of Peewee by 6 metal, and cost of Ak reduced by 6 metal
  * Added Experimental Nano-Towers, they can be disabled, but this is good to stop swarm construction units.
