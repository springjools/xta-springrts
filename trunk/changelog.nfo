------------------- Change Log of XTA 9.73 Svn 375 ------------------ by Deadnight Warrior, Jools, Kloot and Noruas
* Updated Xtaids, added new unitpack that functions, called spiders vs. tortoise. Both work need more balance tests. - Noruas
* Increased cost of Guardian and Punisher shots to double, from 250 to 500 per shot, roughly twice as much and a bit more then a pop up cannon at 230 Energy. - Noruas
* Reduced cost of stealthing for Cloakable fusion reactors and spy kbots by 50E
* Added area guard gadget and widget combo. Works like area attack but for guard command. Enable/disable by toggling the Area 
  Guard widget in F11 menu. Widget listens to keyboard shortcut "g". The widget has three modes:
  - Basic mode: drag over units to guard, all selected units will guard all units.
  - Distributive mode (hold alt and drag): distribute the guard task into squadrons based on how many units you have selected
    to guard.
  - Persistent mode (hold alt+ctrl and drag): makes the squadrons permanent. When one unit in the squadron gets damaged, the 
    unit guarding the squadron will shift the guard task to prioritise the unit wth least health. Selecting a unit that is 
    guarding a squadron and pressing "stop" will also clear the guard task.
* New spectator mode in commander change widget
* Added buttons for selecting game speed when watching replays
* Bugfixes: 
  - Added missing minelayer-limit icons, fixed bug for xtaids hovercraft minelayers. - Jools
  - Mine layer gadget fixed for XTAids units and other bugs - Noruas
  - Fixed a bug with moho metal maker's missing explosions: they were set to "", now they use same explosions as in BA (ATOMIC_BLASTSML and ATOMIC_BLAST)
  - Fixed minelayer mine-limit exploit. Now it won't finish the mine if it's not in stock.
  - Fixed double projectile for CORE Garpike and ARM Crab, making then quite OP for their price
  - Fixed Dynamic Collision Volume gadget not scaling 3DO model radius and height if used for a unit with a dynamic CV
  - Fixed many oversized collision volumes, happened due to changes in 94.1 engine
* Performance improvements:
  - Add flood protection to local sounds gadget
  - Optimizations in following widgets:
    - Major: Adv. Players List, Commander Selection, Commander Nametags
    - Minor: Ghost Radar, Mission UI, BuildETA, UnitGroups
    - Symbolical: BuildBar, Waypoint Dragger, Selection Buttons
  - Improve performance of Dynamic Lighting when used together with Local Sounds, otherwise no performance change
  - Updated CustomFormations to show end points for unit destinations, some other small fixes
  - Halved the number of flame projectiles per second for Pyros and Levelers, damage and visuals adjusted to look and feel as before
* SVN:
  - Rename all files that had upper-case letters to lower-case (fixes possible linux vs windows issues)


------------------- Change Log of XTA v9.729 ------------------ by Deadnight Warrior, Jools and Noruas and Knorke
* Added animals that wander around the map:
  - critters are invisible on minimap+radar and have a blank icon, as not to be confused with player units
  - enjoy the amazing duck and friends!
  - i tried to not make them interfere with gameplay as much as possible:
  - for now, mostly only on ffa maps where it often has less serious games anyway
  - attacking them is not possible, to avoid units accidently following them around the map
  - critters are placed in ways where they will not get in the way
  - they can be reclaimed instantly (should they block construction)
  - they are killed easily (near explosions etc)
  - but still they CAN decloak cloaked units..not sure how to fix that and how much it matters. if in doubt, reclaim them.
  - they spawn on the maps defined in gaia_critters_config.lua
  - modoptions "critters" = false to turn them off.
* Some bugfixes: missing sound on volume control and bug in commander change widget.
! The downloads of 9.728 got corrupted, which caused desyncs. So this release is mostly an attempt to fix this.
	
------------------- Change Log of XTA v9.728 ------------------ by Deadnight Warrior, Jools and Noruas
* Fix landboat transition from land to water
* Improve commander selection widget (remembers selection from last game, better countdown text)
* Bugfixes for minelayer and buildspeed gadgets (probable cause for error: builder died)
* New sounds for D-Gun, Arm Penetrator and Core Doomsday machine. Sounds by Noruas. Should be less disturbing.
* Update cursor out of range gadget. It now gets range from engine. Cursor will still show bad attack cursor if 
  attack is blocked, but attack order is only dropped if it is outside of range (only for turrets).
* New splash sound for lava maps.
* Builders can now again fight.
* Fix hitsoundwet sound for Arm Bulldog
* Optimise MinimapX gadget to use less fps
* Force some gadgets that wouldn't unload to really do so (gadgets that have synced and unsynced parts).

	
------------------- Change Log of XTA v9.727 ------------------ by Deadnight Warrior, Jools 
* Widget to set commander as member of group number 1 on gamestart (default disabled).
* Add avoidGround=0; and avoidNeutral=0; to disintegrator weapons.
* Update mission stuff
* Add debug mode (allows gadget profiler to run, use it to troubleshoot which gadget is the problem)
* Remove stop and wait commands from units that cannot do that,
  remove fight from units that cannot attack (like mine layers, construction
  units, air scouts, spies), remove attack from anti-nukes (they still do their
  thing), remove move, attack and patrol from air repair pad. Add a self-destruct
  button to all units (can be hidden with hidecommands.lua widget, that widget
  added to xta but isn't enabled by default).
* Nerf ambusher and toaster range from 1330 to 1250 as it was in kloot's patches. Increase flak-weapon's
  projectile speed and areaofeffect (they differ, but for example arm flakker has
  speed 1950 -> 2450 and aoe 150 -> 176), and decrease their damage vs ground
  units by about 30%. Decreased flakker projectile's amount of particles from 20
  to 10 and their separation from 0.35 to 0.15.
* Changed dragon's teeth's collision volume scales: arm: 28 34 28 -> 26 34 26,
  core: 26 36 26 -> 26 36 26, so that they let more shots pass.
* Fix for anti-nuke interception fail
* Set cannon velocity default to 0.25 instead of 0.5
* Add reclaim method as mod option: continuous = instant reclaim, discreet = lump sum reclaim after completion
* Fix hammer and jeffy
* Add snd_volume_osd widget. Decrease/Increase sound with - and +. Engine changed the shortcut for speed change to alt - +/-
* Prevent crashing aircraft from continuing to fire on enemies.	
	
	
------------------- Change Log of XTA v9.726 (94.0 and next version) ------------------ by Deadnight Warrior, Kloot, Jools, NTG and Scifi

New features or technical changes:
----------------------------------
* Minelayers have a limited stock of mines (arm: 5, core: 6, naval: 8). Restocking costs same as building new minelayer (this is due to the fact that it's not as easy to build sensitive equipment such as mines in the field as inside factory conditions).
* Changed the collision volume of dragon's teeth so that scouts can fire through. Will still require micro. Increased dt hit points back to previous value, because otherwise they get destroyed too quickly due to changes in engine i n v. 93 ->
* Decreased duck odds from 1:100 to 1:1000
* Changed some effects in water explosions, they are now different depending on water depth and explosion impact altitude
* removed beeps from people placing their commander at start window (everybody hates it)
* Units do not target crashing aircraft (no change from latest patch)
* New sounds when units cloak or self-d (all combined in widget: xta unit sounds). 
* Removed global sounds when commander cloaks or is repaired.

* Neutron: ennergycost: 258882 -> 129441, buildtime: 196784 -> 124423
* Zeus: HP: 3100 -> 4200 (no change from latest patch)

------------------- Change Log of XTA v9.726 beta (89.0 and next version) ------------------ by Deadnight Warrior and Jools
* Decoy commanders now have same cloak radius as their respective normal commanders. Their weapons ranges now show as that of normal commanders to enemies, but show still are actual ones to allies.Decoys can be upgrades to level 2 decoys, which can disguise as opposite faction commanders. Level 2 decoys appear to enemies as level 2 commanders (D-Gun still reveals though).
* Added original commander ends option
* Renamed modoptions: renamed "teamdeathmode" to "mode" and "comm" to "commander" to make it easier to use autohost  commands. mode options are: "killall" (kill all units and remove dead players), "comends" (team commander ends), "commander" (original commander ends), "team" (kill all units and retain dead players) and "none" (game never ends). Spads command "!bset mode killall" replaces old "!bset teamdeathmode allyzerounits" which was a bit complicated.

* Added Particle Light widget for faked light effects on cannon shells and laser cannons
* Some small unit script fixes and optimizations

* adjusted torpedo and adv. torpedo launchers min water depth and water line so that they don't sink into sea floor and can't shoot
* adjusted rocket and missile flightTime to avoid excessive overshooting of max range when firing at aircraft

	
------------------- Change Log of XTA v9.725 (89.0 and next version) ------------------ by Deadnight Warrior, Jools and Kloot
* Added support for changing Commanders in-game. New modoption: let users choose in game. Renamed Commander options to Automatic and Manual Commanders.
* Rewrote commander selection widget from scratch. Now it interacts with initial queue and advanced playerslist, and also has some more functionality than the normal interface during pre-game phase (such as a gong-gong sound when game starts). Commanders are set to hold position on startup rather than maneuver.
* Added "Team death on zero commanders", game mode that got removed with Spring 84 engine change
* Adjusted the default on/off for many widgets
* Updated several gadgets and widgets to newer versions
* Fixed the following widgets to work with current version of spring (version 85 and above): dontshoot (puts commander on hold fire during cloak), forcecloak(gives a wait order to the commander if user wants to cloak while the commander is in the process of building something)
* Added following widgets: Red_resourcebars and red_tooltip (they need red_ui_framework and red_ui_drawing to work), gui_point_tracker (displays labels added by other players on minimap), Ghosted Buildings and Ghosted radar
* Improved Default XTA GUI Layout widget with the ability to select different icon grid sizes: 3x8, 4x9 and 5x11 icons in Ctrl+F11 mode
* Added an explosion effect to all gunships (they currently lacked one). Added a splash effect to explosions on water.
* Fixed "King of The Hill" mode, no cloaked or stunned units, or units not on ground can maintain control. Added reminder and countdown sound when 30 secs left in KoTH mode.
* Fixed many unwanted reverts that happened when releasing 9.71 (Raven, and Hammer/Thud are affected mostly)
* Added RadarEmitHeight and LOSEmitHeight values to all towers, commanders and big ships, makes them see better on bumpy terrain or when climbing hills
* Added option to adjust custom gravity of cannon weapons (effectivly it changes their projectile speed, smaller number -> slower cannon, default 0.5)
* Added Plain Commander, without any upgrades
* Added mod option do enable or disable aircraft vs aircraft collision, default no collision
* All defense towers' aimspot now back in center, Spring 89.0 no longer supports modelCenterOffset tag, and it's an annoyance to adjust those via LUA, result, towers are less protected by dragon teeth walls
* Expanded unit description for rocket toggle units so players can see which units can toggle rockets (and what type of rockets) before building them
* Togglable rocket units now show attack range properly
* Radar jammers, mine layers and mobile anti-nukes set to hold position by default
* Fixed many yardmaps that caused warnings in the develop build, improves compatibility with upcoming Spring release
* Fixed CORE Construction sub description having excess delimiters
* Fixed Auto-upg. commanders wandering off into battle when set on maneuver, and always having max velocity regardless of XP (requires Spring 89)
* Fixed starting resources always set to 1000/1000
* Added dynamic lighting gadget, used for some (mostly large) explosions
* Some updates in LUPS modules
* Fixed lag when Flebowl boss is killed (not that it matters as the fleabowl gadget is still broken)
* Added gadget for QTPFS units-stuck-in-factory bug workaround
* Several gadgets updated for better MT compatibility
* Combined Passive Builders and Build Speed gadgets into one, now uses just one command button instead of two

* Added a rudimentary mission scripting gadget and 2 demo missions, look for details in XTA.sd7/Missions/Readme.txt

--- Requites 89.0 to work ---
* Updated Dynamic Collision Volume gadget for better map feature and unit CV and radius scaling
* Renamed all soundHit tags in weaponDefs to soundHitDry, to be up to date with 89.0
* Added weapon water hit sounds
* Renamed cylinderTargetting to cylinderTargeting for engine compatibility
* Added Sounds.lua for small randomization of general sound effects


------------------- Change Log of XTA v9.71 (85.0 and next version) ------------------ by Deadnight Warrior
* When cleaning the game archive from useless files some unit build icons got cleaned in the process, now back
* Hammers can now shoot while moving, bug in previous release
* Brawler spray angle reduced from 5° to 3°
* Given custom collision volumes to 13 wrecks that had interfered with proper aiming
* Slightly lowered the collision volumes (vertical offset -1) of Dragon Teeth

* Added "Low Performance" game mode that removes all CEG trails and increases reload time and damage of fast fire weapons (this mode is for slow CPUs or playing against many AIs)
* Buildbar widget no longer treats repair pads as factories
* Engine Pathfinding system can be chosen in mod options
* Added custom collision volumes for wrecks that cause aiming problems (towers and factories mostly)
* Finetuned Dynamic Collision Volume gadget for 3DO wreck scaling (for smaller units it's almost spot on), works only on Spring 84.0 and up, added support for dynamic PerPieceCollisionVolumes
* Replaced metal maker control widget with gadget, gives better control over metal makers and reduces net traffic, makers themselves no longer produce M, it's all controled via gadget rules, keep the "Energy Conversion" info panel on for conversion details
* Separated /Units/ folder into categories, easier to see which unit belongs to which game option / unit pack
* Removed unused widgets (bloom and chili) from release, they are still available on XTA on-line repository
* Massive cleanup of release archive from all files not needed to play the game, they are still available on XTA on-line repository
* Temporarly disabled Fleabowl mode till the spawner gadget gets fixed

* Swaped costs of mobile and stationary T2 radars as stationary where more expensive and more fragile than mobile ones
* Swaped radar jamming distance of kbot and vehicle jammers as vehicle jammers are more expensive and vehicles are generaly larger than kbots
* Some unit script fixes and optimizations and collision volume adjustments
* "Sweetspot" of all land defence towers is now line with DT height which covers them from straight line fire from ground level
* ARM & CORE Destroyer ship's range increased to match FHLT and reload time reduced by 16.7%
* Increased speed of T1 fighters by ~15%, makes them better against bombers and less good against ground
* CORE Doomsday Machine increased buildtime to match ARM Annihilator, increased cost by same factor (5.74%)
* CORE Rapier reload time increased so that it's DPS matches that of ARM Brawler
* Commanders are now almost as fast in water as they are on land
* Adv. construction subs can now build Adv. shipyards
* Crawling bombs now have their own moveDef (amphibious 1x1) are have better slope tolerance
* Heavy tanks use 3x3 and not 4x4 moveDef footprint, less traffic jams and those units are 3x3 and not 4x4 in size to begin with
* T2 transport aircraft can now load T2 crawling bombs (max 4)
* Slightly increased metal extractor and moho mine slope tolerance
* Increased ARM Infiltrator cost to match CORE Parasite, cloak, moving cloak & stealth costs now 150/300/600 for Infiltrator, 125/275/550 for Parasite, Infiltrator LoS set to 375, Parasite 320
* Cannon weapons have a nice arc trajectory (relative to target range, at max range it's always 45° elevation)
* All weapons that cause an explosion when impacting on target, now have increased AoE and edgeEffectiveness=0 if their edgeEffectiveness was > 0 and AoE<145, AoE increase is to 160 max
* Some floating and underwater buildings have their min water depth increased to prevent them from sinking into sea bottom
* Added Open/Close mode selection for all pop-up style units (Ambusher, Annihilator, Doomsday Machine, Toaster, Viper)

* Added "Active/Passive" control to all construction units, "Passive" wont build when stalling
* Added production speed control to all factories, can adjust build speed from 25% to 100% in 25% steps

These are still under probation, might not hang around for long:
 - Disabled Aircraft and hovercraft on maps with no atmosphere, disabled Aircraft on maps with extreme wind (min>30 or max>35)
 - ARM Ravens fire twice as many rockets per salvo that do half the damage each, AoE +50%, edgeEffectiveness=0, accuracy slightly increased, this gives Ravens a better area coverage with more evently distributed damage and less random strayed rockets


------------------- Change Log of XTA v9.666 (0.82.7 and next version) ------------------ by Deadnight Warrior
* Wombats and Nixers range reduced from 1300 to 1150
* Merls and Diplomats reload time reduced by 1 sec, increased mobility by 20%

------------------- Change Log of XTA v9.66 (0.82.7 and next version) ------------------ 
  -------------- by Noruas
* Level 1 Arm Lurker and Core Snake area of effect increased radius from 16 to 128, making them more effective against scouts and bunched tidal generators.
* Nerfed Kamikaze Subs from 2500 damage to 1900, and from 2500 to 1000 against commanders, now requiring 4 to guarantee a kill.
* Amphibious Boats can now also be built from the advanced vehicle plant. I would recommend against it on land maps since every land unit does what it does better and faster.
* Arm Core Decoy Commanders can now capture, to add more combat utillity requested by Pintle.
* Fixed some of the Invisible Particles that were still rendered.
* Doubled Accuracy of Crusader and Enforcer
* Reduced Scout boat speeds from an average of 3.7 to 3.2 so kiting will be more difficult.  This is still a minor nerf. 
* Increased buildtime of arm skeeter boat scout by 50 percent to match core searcher. (balance issue)
* Because of the cost and health of spiders, they have been shrunk from 3x3 to 2x2 footprint size, should be easier to use now.
* Added New Lua that prevents nuke particles from spawning if blocked by an antinuke.
* Added two new nuke effects that are appropiate sizes for the arm nuke and core nuke.
* Made some old effects less particle spammy. You will be able to see the difference.

  -------------- by Deadnight Warrior

* ARM Metal Maker now turns it's light on/off depending on it's production state
* Increased agility of ARM Atlas and CORE Valkyrie
* Increased turret/torso turn speed for all T1 land units and all T2 Kbots that have weapons
* Increased Stumpy/Raider damage to non-commanders by 25%  so far Flash/Gator are still better than Stumpy/Raider if combat groups are of equal total M cost
* Increased weapon speed of almost all lasers (except for very short range ones), they now hit their target more often and sooner
* Jeffy/Weasel HP, M & E cost reduced to 2/3, build time reduced to 5/6, sight range increased by 54%  as proposed by several community members
* Adjusted Jeffy/Weasel wreckage M value (39M/40M)
* Increased LLT DPS by 23% (damage +10%, reload time -11%)
* Reduced LLTs sight range to 580 (weapon range + 30)

* Fixed COB error spam when using ARM Decoy Commander's fake D-Gun (bug brought to life in 9.641b)
* Fixed radars turning off right after being constructed (partly or not at all, as it's related to your E production/consumption rate)
* Mines now have very low profile, making most projectiles fly over them instead of crashing into
* Aircraft plants added option to set default commands to aircraft, Land/Fly and Land at XX%
* Unit experience is slightly more pronounced than in previous versions
* Hovercraft transporters don't draw their crane faster than Lucky Luke, but at a reasonable tempo

------------------- Change Log of XTA v9.601 - v9.6.3 (0.80 and next version) ------------------ by various
Various test versions and some quick sloppy fixes for Spring 0.82 support


------------------- Change Log of XTA v9.6 (0.77b43 and next version) ------------------ by
* Flash and Peewee weapon accuracy increased.
* Added some lua, fixed some lua...
* Added two new units that walk upon the land.
* Nerfed Hitpoints of Instigator back to 810 from 844.
* Added two new bombers that tech 1.5 for the seaplane platform. These Bombers are slower but can take more damage and deal damage for its cost, best used on the frontline, these bombers are not good for passing defense.
* Fixed some Line of Sight issues 


------------------- Change Log of XTA v9.585 (0.77b43 and next version) ------------------ by noruas
* Evil Krogoth Lag Bug fixed, it also lagged the CPU elsewhere before being finished built.
* Arm and Core Torpedo Launchers in tech 1 are now Long Range Depth Chargers, they also have names now, Arm is Fisherman, while Core is Shrimper. 
* Boat DepthChargers have 6 times the turnrate for accuracy improvements.
* Increased range of Raven from 1200 to 1400, making it the only arty to outrange the popup cannons, but, it's very inaccurate at that range.
* Added 50 Percent HP to Vehicle Mine Layers
* Doubled Hp of Amphibious vehicle builders.
* Spider laser has 20 particles vs 200 particles per beam, because I hear that Pentium 3s cry at night.
* Hitsphers of mobile units are more accurate to the shape of the unit.
* Jethros no longer hit each other when lined up firing from its broadside in close packs.
* Spider has the ability to EMP overload itself, causing itself 33.4 percent damage and temporary paralyzing itself for 10-50 seconds. The small area surrounding the Spider takes mediocre damage and heavy paralyze damage of 5000, two Spiders can disarm a Bulldog or a Reaper. Takes one second to overload, and during that second, it will not fire.
* Hovercraft transports now cost an additional 300 metal and 2000 E, with 1000 hp added to its health, much more inefficient and cost something awful to lose in midgame, or use as a stealer.
* Reduced damage rate of peewee from 60 to 50 per second.
* Increased hitpoints of A.K. and Instigator, the Peewee and Flash counter. Reduced metal of A.K. by 1 metal point. A.K. and Instigator will lose in close combat vs its counter part, and has less speed, but it has higher range which makes it able to have an initiative blow or the ability to kite for short time.
* Tech 2 aircraft plants now have take 18 energy a second and has tech 2 radar range, just as tech 1 air labs do with tech 1 radars.
* Farks and Necros now self-repair at 2 hitpoints per second, still remain fragile.
* Tech 1 bombers behave better, bomb more likely. Downside, they fly through each other.
* Reduced scout missile from 730 to 630 range, but has better flight time to follow air units outside its range. Added new sound and trail effect for its small missile, as well as some arc fire.

* Mine Layers now have a 5 second timer, called self-charge, which broadcast sounds and bright colors to all players as warning, side effect type thing before exploding, after 3 seconds, in the fourth second before discharge, self D will release a minesweeping effect if cancelled. After the 5th second, it explodes like a light mine.
* Tics and Spidey mine sweeper spider kbots can now burrow through upgrade atm and cloak like a normal mine, can chain explode, take full damage from other mines, but has increased hitpoints.
