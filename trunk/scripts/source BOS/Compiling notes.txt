Kbots and vehicles need linear constant of 65536, while ships use 163840. Use scriptor's settings menu
to adjust. Or decompile then compile with same linear constant.
If you want to use the same numbers in BOS for linear movement as in UpSpring
set linear constant to 81920, this is only for X,Z axis, Y axis uses 65536 as
linear constant (only for 3DO, S3O uses 65536 for all axes).
