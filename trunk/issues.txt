Existing:

* Units with oversized Collision Volumes: arm_vanguard, core_viking, arm_fusion_reactor, core_krogoth, arm_advanced_radar_tower, arm_naval_flakker, core_naval_cobra, arm_skeeter, core_searcher, arm_moho_mine, core_moho_mine, arm_sentry, core_stinger, core_underwater_metal_storage, core_resistor, core_pillager

* Air labs keep their radar spinning no matter if they are on or off — except Arm T1 Airlab, whose radar is always in not spinning state. Carriers spins their radars too no matter if they are on or off. 
Fixed carriers, airlabs pending

* Pelicans are seen as hovers even when walking (had *2 speed on icy run)
  Next spring has a possibility to set movetype on the run, then this can be fixed.
