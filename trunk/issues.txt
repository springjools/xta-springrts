Old issues, mostly details. From http://springrts.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=29248&p=534115#p534115

* I got these errors on spring 94.1 when shooting with penetrator:

[f=0003075] [UnitScript] Error: Invalid explosion generator index for emit-sfx (in scripts/arm_penetrator.cob:ON at 59)
[f=0003077] [UnitScript] Error: Invalid explosion generator index for emit-sfx (in scripts/arm_penetrator.cob:ON at 55)
-Does not happen in dev build, it's also not a script error, must be related to FBI and explosiongenerator0=custom:UNITFIRE;


* Annihilator shoots before it has aimed. It shoots the first beam before the turret has targeted on target, and the first beam goes to a random direction, sometimes it hits self.
	- Also applies for penetrator
-This is not an issue, it's happens in dev build due to all BeamLasers having sweepfire enabled by default in order to test the sweepfire fix



* Units with oversized Collision Volumes: 

x 	arm_vanguard, 
x	core_viking, 
x	arm_fusion_reactor, 
x	core_krogoth, 
x	arm_advanced_radar_tower, 
x	arm_naval_flakker, 
x	core_naval_cobra, 
x	arm_skeeter, 
x	core_searcher, 
x	arm_moho_mine, 
x	core_moho_mine, 
x	arm_sentry, 
x	core_stinger, 
x	core_underwater_metal_storage, 
x	core_resistor, 
x	core_pillager

x = fixed


* Air labs keep their radar spinning no matter if they are on or off — except Arm T1 Airlab, whose radar is always in not spinning state.


* Pelicans are seen as hovers even when walking (had *2 speed on icy run)
  Next spring has a possibility to set movetype on the run, then this can be fixed.


* Static turrets can not guard other units, althought they have canguard=1 in unitdef. Maybe redui bug, maybe engine bug, maybe feature?


*Spiders are paralysed by fellow spiders EMP-overcharging. Feature or bug?


*Widgets that are known to be hungry:
	- Healthbars (1st priority)
	- Ghost Radar
	- Ghost Site
	- Advanced playerslist (with version 9.729, may be already fixed)
	- RedUI Drawing
	- RedUI Framework
