* Static turrets can not guard other units, althought they have canguard=1 in unitdef. Maybe redui bug, maybe engine bug, maybe feature?

* if morphing and game ends:

[f=0053439] Error: LuaRules::RunCallIn: error = 2, AllowCommand, [string "LuaRules/Gadgets/unit_morph.lua"]:548: GiveOrderToUnit() recursion is not permitted

Probably because on game ends the stop command is given and that reaches stop morph probably through allow command somehow.
