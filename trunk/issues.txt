1) Both T1 radars leave wreck when they self destruct.

Fixed (when dnw commits)

2)  Core Eraser and Arm Spector (Kbot jammers), once turned off no longer spin even when turned on.

3) There is a problem with Seer (Arm vehicle mobile radar), it spins no matter if you turn it off or on.

4) Air labs keep their radar spinning no matter if they are on or off — except Arm T1 Airlab, whose radar is always in not spinning state. Carriers spins their radars too no matter if they are on or off. 

5) No Tech 2 constructors can make sub pens (50% Confirmed. Arm T2 sub can make sub pens, but not core. Should be fixed.)

6) T2 construction subs need water radar next to standard radar in build menu.

7) Pelicans are seen as hovers even when walking (had *2 speed on icy run)

8) Many units have a "fight" button despite not having a weapon eg: Spy bots, construction units, minelayers, jammers, radars etc. Confirmed for minelayer and jammer. Didn't find it for any radar.

9) Some structures have "Wait", "Repeat" and "Stop" despite no need, eg fusion reactors.

10 Light carriers have "Reclaim", "Restore" and "Repair", despite not being able to do any (unless a plane lands on them).
