* These units have a ModelCenterOffset tag in unitdef, but according to wiki it was removed in spring 89.0 and should be set with lua. Maybe it has already been dealt with but here is a list anyway:

	arm_albatross
	arm_hawk
	arm_metal_extractor
	arm_ornith
	arm_phoenix
	arm_seahawk
	arm_thunder
	arm_tornado
	core_adv_construction_aircraft
	core_avenger
	core_construction_aircraft
	core_construction_seaplane
	core_fink
	core_hunter
	core_hurricane
	core_metal_extractor
	core_rapier
	core_shadow
	core_titan
	core_toaster
	core_typhoon
	core_valkyrie
	core_vamp
	core_viper
	core_voodoo
	core_vulture


* Pelicans are seen as hovers even when walking (had *2 speed on icy run)
  Next spring has a possibility to set movetype on the run, then this can be fixed.


* Static turrets can not guard other units, althought they have canguard=1 in unitdef. Maybe redui bug, maybe engine bug, maybe feature?


*Widgets that are known to be hungry:
	- Healthbars (1st priority)
	- Ghost Radar
	- Ghost Site
	- Advanced playerslist (with version 9.729, may be already fixed)
	- RedUI Drawing
	- RedUI Framework
