Old issues, mostly details. From http://springrts.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=29248&p=534115#p534115

Existing:
---------

4) Air labs keep their radar spinning no matter if they are on or off — except Arm T1 Airlab, whose radar is always in not spinning state. Carriers spins their radars too no matter if they are on or off. 
Fixed carriers, airlabs pending

7) Pelicans are seen as hovers even when walking (had *2 speed on icy run)
-- Next spring has a possibility to set movetype on the run, then this can be fixed.

12)

Units with oversized Collision Volumes: arm_vanguard, core_viking, arm_fusion_reactor, core_krogoth, arm_advanced_radar_tower, arm_naval_flakker, core_naval_cobra, arm_skeeter, core_searcher, arm_moho_mine, core_moho_mine, arm_sentry, core_stinger, core_underwater_metal_storage, core_resistor, core_pillager



Fixed:
------

1) Both T1 radars leave wreck when they self destruct.
Fixed (when dnw commits)

2)  Core Eraser and Arm Spector (Kbot jammers), once turned off no longer spin even when turned on.
Fixed

3) There is a problem with Seer (Arm vehicle mobile radar), it spins no matter if you turn it off or on.
Fixed

5) No Tech 2 constructors can make sub pens (50% Confirmed. Arm T2 sub can make sub pens, but not core. Should be fixed.)
Fixed

6) T2 construction subs need water radar next to standard radar in build menu.
Fixed

8) Many units have a "fight" button despite not having a weapon eg: Spy bots, construction units, minelayers, jammers, radars etc. Confirmed for minelayer and jammer. Didn't find it for any radar.
Fixed

9) Some structures have "Wait", "Repeat" and "Stop" despite no need, eg fusion reactors.
Fixed

10 Light carriers have "Reclaim", "Restore" and "Repair", despite not being able to do any (unless a plane lands on them).
Fixed

11) Customformations doesn't work as line attack if you draw a line over water. It has to be modified so that it sends surface water attack order instead of sea bottom coordinates to units that can not water attack. See: http://springrts.com/mantis/view.php?id=3539
Fixed
