f lightning effects on commander, infantry kbots and some other units are too intense, making the weapons look more powerful than they are
 
- TLL RainMan has a typo in the description, it also has its arm branches made too thin horizontally, looks weird. Should also be classified as "medium" instead of heavy
 
- TLL Ariman should be classified as medium tank instead of heavy tank
 
- TLL Burner script is bugged, tries to restore aim after every shot. Has bug where projectiles disappear mid-air sometimes
 
- TLL Spreader is broken, it consistently shoots past its target and sometimes can't hit it at all
 
- TLL Binder should have cannons consistent with the burner cannon as it shoots similar projectiles. Also it isn't pitching its arms vertically when aiming, and projectile origins are out of position. Has bug where projectiles disappear mid-air sometimes
